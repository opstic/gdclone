# GDClone

<br />

**An attempt at a alternative GD client.**

Built using Bevy engine and Rust.

## Usage

~~Grab the lastest binary from [releases](https://github.com/opstic/gdclone/releases) then copy your `Resources` folder from GD into the `assets` folder.~~

**No release yet, sorry :(**

*You'll have to build the app yourself for now.*

Your files should be like this: `<Your GD folder>/Resources` -> `GDClone/assets/Resources`

You'll also have to copy your `CCLocalLevels.dat` to the `assets` folder.

`%LOCALAPPDATA%/GeometryDash/CCLocalLevels.dat` -> `GDClone/assets/CCLocalLevels.dat`

Controls are WASD to move, use arrow keys to move slower, hold left-shift to move faster.

Q and E to zoom in and out.
