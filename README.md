# NOTICE

This project is currently on haitus, due to the limitations of Bevy engine on performance, I will attempt to create a custom game engine first to improve performance and then continue the project there.

In the mean time, go take a look at [GDRender](https://github.com/maxnut/gdrender), I helped a lot with the project over there and it's currently much more feature complete than the current GDClone. But efforts are expected to merge once the haitus ends.

# GDClone

<br />

**An attempt at an alternative GD client.**

Built using Bevy engine and Rust.

## Usage

Grab the latest binary from [releases](https://github.com/opstic/gdclone/releases) then just run it.

A GD install and valid CCLocalLevels.dat are required.

**Binaries for Linux aren't available, so you'll need to compile it yourself.**

*Support for web and mobile platforms are planned.*

Controls are WASD to move, use arrow keys to move slower, hold left-shift to move faster.

Q and E to zoom in and out.

Use Esc to exit out of a level.
