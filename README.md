# GDClone

<br />

**An attempt at a alternative GD client.**

Built using Bevy engine and Rust.

## Usage

~~Grab the latest binary from [releases](https://github.com/opstic/gdclone/releases) then just run it.~~

**No release yet, sorry :(**

*You'll have to build the app yourself for now.*

Controls are WASD to move, use arrow keys to move slower, hold left-shift to move faster.

Q and E to zoom in and out.
